# Modern Desktop Application
Trying to identify modern pattern for Desktop Application

This repository tries to identify how modern patterns heavily used in web application & cloud services can apply to desktop application.
This focus mainly on the .NET platform, with either Avalonia or WPF as a UI platform.
It is also in the context of a application delivered to customer where the customer decide of some lifetime events, not when the developer can force the deployment/upgrade on a company set of devices.
